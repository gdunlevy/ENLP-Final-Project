# ENLP-Final-Project
Pun Detection: https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task7/

can look into using

	The number of words that are predicted differently if one word Ï‰ is masked, using BERT.
	
	the pun word is usually in second half of the phrase. Get pos of words in the sentence, then look at the second half, get rid of any stop words/punctiation. Then look at the remining words and their defintions? 


Homographic Puns: 
	these are puns that are the same word but different meanings. 
		
		Look into PoS and then look at the defintions and can elminate words that have only 1. 
		Can get rid of stop words in this case. 
		

Hetergraphic Puns: 
	these are puns that sound similar. 
		
		Can look into PoS but it might not be helpful 
		
		can also look ar definitions 
		
		word similarity would work
		
		can look at sense of words -- see if there is something that looks for similar sounding words????
